* Poincaré Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations

PyTorch implementation of [[https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7213-poincare-embeddings-for-learning-hierarchical-representations][Poincaré Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations]]

** Example: Embedding WordNet Mammals
To embed the transitive closure of the WordNet mammals subtree, first generate the data via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd wordnet
  make
#+END_SRC
This will generate the transitive closure of the full noun hierarchy as well as of the mammals subtree of WordNet. 

** Witout Distributed training i.e. using only pytorch multi-threading
To embed the mammals subtree in the reconstruction setting without distributed training, go to the pytorch directory of the project and run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  NTHREADS=2 ./mammal_nodist.sh
#+END_SRC
This shell script includes the appropriate parameter settings for the mammals subtree and saves the trained model as =mammal.pth=. 


To embed the noun subtree in the reconstruction setting without distributed training, go to the pytorch directory of the project and run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  NTHREADS=2 ./noun_nodist.sh
#+END_SRC
This shell script includes the appropriate parameter settings for the mammals subtree and saves the trained model as =noun.pth=. 

** Distributed training using Horovod
To embed the mammals subtree in the reconstruction setting without distributed training, go to the pytorch directory of the project and run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  NTHREADS=2 ./mammal_dist.sh
#+END_SRC
This shell script includes the appropriate parameter settings for the mammals subtree and saves the trained model as =mammal.pth=. 


To embed the noun subtree in the reconstruction setting without distributed training, go to the pytorch directory of the project and run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  NTHREADS=2 ./noun_dist.sh
#+END_SRC
This shell script includes the appropriate parameter settings for the mammals subtree and saves the trained model as =noun.pth=. 

** Dependencies
- Python 3 with NumPy
- PyTorch
- Horovod
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK (to generate the WordNet data)

** Plots and Logs
All the relevant plots and logs are stored in the plots and logs sub-directories.
